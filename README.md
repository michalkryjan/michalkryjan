- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @michalkryjan
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in backend, mainly in developing desktop and web applications using Python and Django.
- ðŸŒ± Currently I'm looking for a job as Junior Python Developer so I'm open to any offers which can make my dreams come true :) In the meantime I keep on self-developing, learning new stuff and working on my projects.

- 👋 Hi, I’m @michalkryjan
- 👀 Programming is my passion and I’m interested in backend, mainly developing desktop and web applications using Python or Django.
- 🌱 Currently my main life goal is to get a job as Junior Python Developer or Python/Django Intern so I'm open to any offers which can make my dreams come true :) In the meantime I keep self-developing, learning new stuff and working on my projects.
- 📫 Bialystok/Warsaw - Poland
